    "## Support Vector Machines\n",
    "Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a kind of geometric machine learning algorithms that find the separating hyperplane between two classes. It was initially designed for binary classification problems, and was later extended to multi-class classification. The goal is to choose the hyperplane with the largest margin between both classes. This, in theory, would give a better classification accuracy for new instances.\n",
